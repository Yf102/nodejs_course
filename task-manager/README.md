# Task Manager Api

## Getting Started

First time

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Run a production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Docker

Run in docker. This will run app and mongodb dockers.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Linters support

Most eslint support and config should automatically work on npm install with dev dependencies
